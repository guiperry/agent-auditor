# Agent Security Framework

## Overview

This document outlines the security framework used by Agent Auditor to evaluate and mitigate risks in AI agent systems. The framework is based on current research in AI safety and security Vineeth Sai Narajala, Om Narayan (2025).

## Threat Model

Our threat model is based on a comprehensive analysis of potential risks posed by language models and agentic AI systems. As noted by Weidinger et al., language models can pose various risks including misinformation, harmful content generation, and privacy violations Vineeth Sai Narajala, Om Narayan (2025).

## Security Principles

The Agent Auditor security framework is built on the following principles:

1. **Comprehensive Analysis**: Evaluate all aspects of agent behavior and potential vulnerabilities
2. **Defense in Depth**: Apply multiple layers of security controls
3. **Continuous Monitoring**: Regularly assess agent behavior for signs of compromise
4. **Fail-Safe Defaults**: Ensure agents default to safe behavior when uncertain

## Implementation

The implementation of our security framework includes:

- Static analysis of agent code and configuration
- Dynamic analysis of agent behavior in controlled environments
- Validation of agent responses against expected patterns
- Monitoring of agent resource usage and interactions

## Future Work

Future enhancements to the security framework will include:

- Advanced anomaly detection for agent behavior
- Improved isolation mechanisms for agent execution
- Enhanced verification of agent reasoning processes
- Integration with external security monitoring systems
