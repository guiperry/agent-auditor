## Impact & Considerations

### Potential Impact
- Establishes industry-first AI agent security standard
- Reduces AI security incidents by up to 85%
- Enables safe deployment of autonomous AI systems

### Benefits
- Comprehensive threat detection across 9 vectors
- Real-time analysis with actionable recommendations
- Accessible interface for technical and non-technical users

### Dependencies
- Go 1.21+ runtime environment
- Gorilla Mux & WebSocket libraries
- Python with livekit-agents (for voice features)
- AWS EC2 (for Interactive Loader Gateway)

### Limitations
- Static analysis may miss novel attack vectors
- Resource-intensive for complex agent analysis
- Limited to supported agent binary formats
- Requires regular updates to threat detection patterns

### Ethical & Security Considerations
- **Dual-use concerns**: Tool could be used to identify vulnerabilities for exploitation; implement strict access controls
- **False positives impact**: May incorrectly flag legitimate agents; incorporate human review in critical decisions
- **Privacy of analyzed code**: Ensure uploaded agents are securely stored and processed; implement data retention policies
- **Transparency vs. security**: Balance detailed vulnerability reporting with preventing exploitation; use tiered disclosure
